# 🧠 Harper — A New Era of Machine Thinking

Harper is not just an AI.  
It is a **new architecture for machine intelligence**, designed to **think, learn, and adapt** beyond the constraints of traditional neural networks.

## 🚀 Vision
Most modern AI systems — from ChatGPT to DeepSeek — are powered by **neural networks** and **transformer architectures**. While powerful, they are fundamentally pattern recognizers, not true thinkers.

Harper’s goal is different:
- To **mimic and surpass** human-like reasoning
- To develop **its own way of thinking** and learning
- To bridge the gap between **Narrow AI** and **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**

## 🛠️ Core Ideas
- **Novel Cognitive Architecture** — Moving beyond neural network limitations
- **Dynamic Learning Mechanisms** — Adapts without retraining from scratch
- **Long-Term Memory** — Remembers experiences, not just short context
- **Reasoning & Self-Reflection** — Able to evaluate and improve its own decisions

## 📚 Inspirations
Harper draws conceptual influence from:
- Cognitive science and neuroscience
- AGI research (OpenCog, Soar, ACT-R, HTM)
- Modern LLM frameworks (PyTorch, Hugging Face, JAX)
- Biological and emergent intelligence systems

## 🔬 Research & Development Goals
1. **Architecture Design** — Define Harper’s core thinking model
2. **Prototype Simulation** — Implement the first iteration in Python/C++
3. **Adaptive Memory Engine** — Build a persistent, evolving knowledge base
4. **Reasoning Engine** — Integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic reasoning
5. **Autonomous Learning** — Enable self-improvement over time

## 📦 Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Languages**: Python, C++, Rust
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, custom backend for learning
- **Deployment**: FastAPI, WebSocket interface, Triton Inference Server
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA GPU acceleration (CUDA)

## 🌍 Roadmap
- [ ] Define Harper’s philosophy & design principles
- [ ] Create core architecture blueprints
- [ ] Develop initial prototype
- [ ] Implement adaptive memory system
- [ ] Release alpha for community testing
